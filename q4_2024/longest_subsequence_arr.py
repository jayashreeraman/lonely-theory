"""
Given an array of numbers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array. 
The subsequence does not necessarily have to be contiguous.

For example, given the array [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15], 
the longest increasing subsequence has length 6: it is 0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15.
